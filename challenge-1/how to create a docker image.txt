Now that you've updated the Dockerfile, you can try rebuilding the image and running it to verify that everything is working correctly.

Here are the steps:

Rebuild the image:
Edit
Copy code
docker build -t my-server .
This will rebuild the image using the updated Dockerfile.

Run the image:
Edit
Copy code
docker run -p 8000:8000 my-server
This will start a new container from the my-server image and map port 8000 on the host machine to port 8000 in the container.

Verify that the container is running:
Edit
Copy code
docker ps
This will show you a list of all running containers, including the one you just started.

Test the application:
Edit
Copy code
curl http://localhost:8000
This will send a request to the application running in the container and print the response to the console.

If everything is working correctly, you should see the output of the chalenge1.py script.

Note: If you want to see the logs of the container, you can use the following command:

Edit
Copy code
docker logs -f my-server
This will show you the latest logs from the container. The -f flag tells Docker to follow the logs, so you'll see new logs as they're generated.
